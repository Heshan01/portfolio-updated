# 🚀 Heshan Samarasinghe — Portfolio

This is my personal developer portfolio built using **React + Vite**, showcasing my projects, skills, and experience in modern web and mobile development.

The site is fast, minimal, and optimized for performance, using Vite’s lightning-fast build system and React’s component-based architecture.
